Interactive emotion recognition based on facial expression using deep learning


This repository is focussed on an interactive emotion recognition which recognizes emotions based on facial expressions. This work is based on [Emotion Recognition using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](Referred_paper.pdf). The model used in this work is pretrained and the same has been fetched from [this repo](https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection).
