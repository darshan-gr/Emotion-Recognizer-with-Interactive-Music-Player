# Emotion-Recognizer-with-Interactive-Music-Player
Interactive emotion recognition based on facial expression using deep learning


This repository is focussed on an interactive emotion recognition which recognizes emotions based on facial expressions. This work is based on [Emotion Recognition using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](Referred_paper.pdf). The model used in this work is pretrained and the same has been fetched from [this repo](https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection).

To use this repo, simply run the [main.py](main.py) file by giving proper paths required and also install the necessary packages. The idea of using interactive system and combined cartoon display is from [here](https://github.com/parthisultimate/EmoTV-ITSP-). 


### To Do:
requirement.txt to be added for ease to install dependencies
More sound files to be added for different emotions
